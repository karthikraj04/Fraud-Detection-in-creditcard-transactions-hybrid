# Hybrid Credit Card Fraud Detection System  

This project implements an end-to-end Faud detection system combining supervised learning and unsupervised anomaly detection. The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced financial datasets with high recall and precision.

The system uses:

- XGBoost (Supervised Model)  
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)  
- Hybrid Fraud Score
